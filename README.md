# CustomTimer

A free C#/.Net countdown timer with support for natural language input. Currently it is entirely © Alan J. Hogan, although I allow free distribution of it and could probably be pursuaded to apply a liberal open-source license if anyone cares. It’s not like this is a super advanced piece of technology; it’s just the first C# program I ever wrote.

It looks like this:

Oh, it gets real fancy and minimizes itself down to the notification area if you want it to.

[Its home page][home] is actually the first post (besides the home page) to ever appear on my website, [alanhogan.com](https://alanhogan.com/), which was then alanjhogan.com.

**[Download the installer there.][home]** Windows will block it from running, but you can ask it nicely and it will ignore the fact that I never "signed" the code. (I am the unknown developer!)
